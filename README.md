# jsPolicy
Kubernetes clusters are now everywhere. To run an ML Model you need a Kubernetes cluster, you want to run Data analytics you need a Kubernetes cluster, to deploy your frontend application, backend application, or any type of application you'd need a Kubernetes cluster. But is your cluster secured? Did you ever worry about the security of the cluster? Assume you are trying to run some automation scripts and it accidentally deleted all the namespaces in Production. Boom, it is going to be the longest day in the life of a DevOps Engineer. Even thinking about this might be giving chills to the DevOps engineers reading this. Is there a way to avoid this? Is there a way to effectively control such disasters? jsPolicy to the rescue. jsPolicy is a policy engine for Kubernetes that allows you to write policies in JavaScript or TypeScript.
