# Multitenancy in Kubernetes using loft.sh vcluster
Kubernetes is almost everywhere. If you want to deploy a web application, you'd need Kubernetes. You'd need to train an ML algorithm ( Kubeflow ) you'd need Kubernetes. Run Data analytics you'd need Kubernetes. So ideally Kubernetes is being used in every possible way. But are you using it the right way? Are you saving costs? Are you making use of the entire compute resources? Are you also sharing it the right way? Ahh, this is the actual point of the article, Multi-Tenancy. Multitenancy is a reference to the mode of operation of software where multiple independent instances of one or multiple applications operate in a shared environment. The instances (tenants) are logically isolated, but physically integrated."Tenants" is a term for a group of users or software applications that all share access to the hardware through the underlying software. Multiple tenants on a server all share the memory, which is dynamically allocated and cleaned up as needed. They also share access to system resources, such as the network controller.
