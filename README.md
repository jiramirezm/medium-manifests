The Kubeflow project is dedicated to making deployments of machine learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable. Kubeflow is the ML toolkit for Kubernetes.A kubeflow pipeline is a description of an ML workflow, including all of the components in the workflow and how they combine in the form of a graph.
